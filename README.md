## About The Project
I did this project because I wanted to use Node.js to create a REST API project and what better way to do that than to create a country Wikipedia. Using REST API and also using `https://restcountries.com/ `API to fetch country information, the user can search any country they like to get the  information and then the information from the API is sent to the front-end and displayed with Jquery.

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
